For a fullcycle build, run Build.bat

You need some additional requirements in order to build successfully:

- Visual Studio 2010
- Visual Studio 2010 SDK
- Xna Game Studio 4.0
- Sandcastle
- Sandcastle Help File Builder
- InstallShield Limited Edition for Visual Studio 2010

You also need to place the root folder at "D:\Nine\", since some InstallShield and Sandcastle features does not support relative file path.

For developers, run Clean.bat before checkin 
to remove all bin,obj folders and .user files.
