<!--
    World is a container that can contain both graphics data and non graphics data, such as physics data and
    game logic related components. It is also much easier to extend the world to fit your custom need.

            GraphicsComponentContent is a built in component that gives this world object a graphical
            appearance. You can add elements to the graphics component just like adding to the scene as
            described previously. During the content build process, these graphics elements will be wrapped
            into a DisplayObject.
