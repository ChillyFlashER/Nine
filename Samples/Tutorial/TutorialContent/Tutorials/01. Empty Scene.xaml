<!--
    This is a basic graphical scene that contains a skybox and some lights.
    
    The root element is a SceneContent that serves as a root container for all graphical objects.
    The minimum setup for a scene typically contains a skybox, an ambient light, a directional light and a fog.
    
    Notice the "Content" suffix in the name of each element. It means that these elements will be processed 
    through the content pipeline. If you add an Xaml file to the content pipeline project, the 
    "Content - Engine Nine" processor will be automatically selected to process the Xaml object graph.
    
    Most of these content elements have a corresponding runtime type without the "Content" suffix, so you can
    access and manipulate them through C# code.

        A cube texture has to be assigned to a skybox.
    
        Notice that the texture references the output .xnb asset file. By default, any reference to external
        asset is the relative path to the output asset (without file extension), this allows you to easily
        specify how the external assets are imported and processed. But there are cases when you have to
        reference the source asset file, which will be stated explicity.
    
        Skybox currently won't show up on Windows Phone.

        You can optionally specify the name of an object and retrieve it using Scene.Find(name) method.

        The ambient light defines the color of an object when it is completely not lit, it will prevent 
        objects looking too dark.

        This is the main directional light of the scene.
