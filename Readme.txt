These are the steps needed to use Engine Nine:


1. Make sure these products are installed.

- Visual Studio 2010 (or Visual C# Express 2010)
- Xna Game Studio 4.0 (Aka, Windows Phone Developer Tools)

2. Run Build/Build.bat as administrator

- You might experence some errors since the full build requires Wix and SandCastle

3. In your Xna project, you can now add Nine.dll/Nine.Content.dll to your project using Add Reference -> .NET

4. In order to build the Engine Nine for Silverlight, you need to install the lastest Silverlight 5 SDK.
