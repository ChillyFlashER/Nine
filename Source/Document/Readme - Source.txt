Isles v0.1 Source Readme File
-----------------------------
Jan. 2008. (c) Nightin Games.


This is the source code for the preliminary version of Isles.
This version demonstrates some landscape rendering features and
a little bit of gameplay. Most of the game features are not
implemented so it is not ready to play. But there are already
some interesting things about the game.

Everybody has their own coding style and design methology, but
do not blame it if you found anything 'ugly' about the code. We
have tried our best to orgnize our code so it is maintainable
and extensible in certain ways under the time pressure.

The project is based on XNA game studio 2.0, so grab it if you
can not open the solution. There are 3 projects under the solution:
Isles, Isles.Engine, Isles.Pipeline. I guess most of the classes
are quite self-explained. The two most important class hierarchies
are the entity system and the landscape. Take a look at them if
you want to dive deep.
